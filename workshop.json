{"workshopId":2411195735,"Title":"Finite Chute Crabs","Description":"Fire becomes ash, trees fall, cities crumble into dust, even gods are, eventually, forgotten. All things must end.\n\nExcept, apparently, for Chute Crabs, who rudely disturb the social and thermodynamic fabric of the universe by pouring eternally from vents one can only imagine leading to alternate universes which have decided to forgo entropy in exchange for crabs.\n\nThe time has come for us to bring down the hammer of law upon these unruly creatures, finally pinning them to the laws that govern our universe and that of Qud.\n\nAnd so, indeed, it is so - the Chute Crabs of Golgotha remain great in number, and lie in wait for poorly prepared wayfarers to swarm and devour - but their numbers are limited, and a determined, patient and well armoured traveller may eventually be able to beat back the tide. \n\nA family species, all chutes contain at least five crabs - any fewer would cause them to become isolated and lonely, and trust me, Chute Crabs may be near intolerable, but a sad Chute Crab will never leave you alone. That said, even social creatures have limits, and indeed vents will never exceed forty crabs, beyond that and social stratification leads to extensive political unrest and civil collapse.\n\nAs of yet this limit does not persist when Qud is saved and reloaded, and thus venturing back into Gologtha may invite another limited but dangerous swarm into your life.
